### Description

Paintify is a showcase platform for visual artist which include painters from a variety of different genres and mediums. This website would use the MEAN Stack and allow users to signup and upload their pictures and be able to comment on other people's artwork. Users are able to view schools in America that have imformation about M.F.A, M.A, B.F.A, and B.A programs for learning art and also information about the instructors teaching.

I was thinking about using Ruby on Rails but I have to do some research.
